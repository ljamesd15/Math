TO DO LIST: 

-- RSA
	Make serializable
	Allow users to authenticate themselves with private key signing.
	add a salt to the start of each block to prevent plain text attacks
	log base 255 of smallest x bit number to get our max encoding lengths
	find a way to make 'e' fairly small and odd (look at OpenSSL documentation)

-- Testing

-- Other
	Diffie-helman
	Maybe elliptic curve
